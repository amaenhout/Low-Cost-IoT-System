# Master Disseration Arthur Maenhout
Our world is becoming overwhelmed by billions of internet-connected devices, an evolution that will grow even more in the upcoming years. By 2020, 50 billion Internet of Things (IoT) objects will connect to the Internet and each other. With this upcoming trend, new technologies are emerging this on hardware, software and communication sides. This dissertation researches what open source technologies are available to develop an IoT system architecture that is inexpensive yet reliable. Besides, this system is implemented within a workshop to investigate if based on the gathered data it can optimise the space usage. Numerous IoT projects have been conducted in all sectors, this by companies and individuals they use either expensive complete IoT systems or developing new systems that are built for a particular project. I argue that we need to combine the knowledge that is developed in new open source technologies with Industry 4.0 devices and spaces to create an overall working system. Based on the literature review and trial and error, a low-cost IoT system architecture is developed. As the system architecture was successfully developed, it got implemented within the workshop. Analysis of the captured data demonstrated that the system was working as it was hoped for. On this basis, this system can be replicated in both industry IoT projects as individual projects. Further research will be needed to identify the optimal sensors to track space usage and so be able to optimise this usage

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running using The Things Network microcontrollers and gateway, a Raspberry Pi and a cloud AWS database

### Prerequisites
The things you will need to buy and install inorder to make use of the system are:

1. Get a Things Network microcontroller:
    * [Node](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/node/)
    * [Uno](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/uno/)
2. Look if there is an LoRaWAN Gateway nearby -> website
    * [Gateway's]()
3. Get a Raspberry Pi Model 3+ B
    * [Raspberry Pi]()
4. Create an account on AWS
    * [AWS Free Tier]()


### Installing 

#### Microcontrollers
As you will find in the Arduino folder, the are three different applications:
1. Environmental:
    * [Node](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/node/)
    * [Uno](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/uno/)
2. Look if there is an LoRaWAN Gateway nearby -> website
    * [Gateway's]()
3. Get a Raspberry Pi Model 3+ B
    * [Raspberry Pi]()
4. Create an account on AWS
    * [AWS Free Tier]()

fork the created arduino files on: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/node/


explain the three different ones

#### Raspberry Pi



Arduino - Files
As this project makes use of different microcontrollers multiple Arduino scripts are created.
